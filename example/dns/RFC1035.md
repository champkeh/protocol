# Domain Names - Implementation and Specification

## 1. Status of this Memo

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1. Overview

The goal of domain names is to provide a mechanism for naming resources in such a way that the names are usable in different hosts, networks, protocol families, internets, and administrative organizations.

From the user's point of view, domain names are useful as arguments to a local agent, called a resolver, which retrieves information associated with the domain name. Thus, a user might ask for the host address or mail information associated with a particular domain name. To enable the user to request a particular type of information, an appropriate query type is passed to the resolver with the domain name. To the user, the domain tree is a single information space; the resolver is responsible for hiding the distribution of data among name servers from the user.

From the resolver's point of view, the database that makes up the domain space is distributed among various name servers. Different parts of the domain space are stored in different name servers, although a particular data item will be stored redundantly in two or more name servers. The resolver starts with knowledge of at least one name server. When the resolver processes a user query it asks a known name server for the information; in return, the resolver either receives the desired information or a referral to another name server. Using these referrals, resolvers learn the identities and contents of other name servers. Resolvers are responsible for dealing with the distribution of the domain space and dealing with the effects of name server failure by consulting redundant databases in other servers.

Name servers manage two kinds of data. The first kind of data held in sets called zones; each zone is the complete database for a particular "pruned" subtree of the domain space. This data is called authoritative. A name server periodically checks to make sure that its zones are up-to-date, and if not, obtains a new copy of updated zones from master files stored locally or in another name server.  The second kind of data is cached data which was acquired by a local resolver. This data may be incomplete, but improves the performance of the retrieval process when non-local data is repeatedly accessed. Cached data is eventually discarded by a timeout mechanism.

This functional structure isolates the problems of user interface, failure recovery, and distribution in the resolvers and isolates the database update and refresh problems in the name servers.

### 2.2. Common configurations

A host can participate in the domain name system in a number of ways, depending on whether the host runs programs that retrieve information from the domain system, name servers that answer queries from other hosts, or various combinations of both functions. The simplest, and perhaps most typical, configuration is shown below:

                 Local Host                        |  Foreign
                                                   |
    +---------+               +----------+         |  +--------+
    |         | user queries  |          |queries  |  |        |
    |  User   |-------------->|          |---------|->|Foreign |
    | Program |               | Resolver |         |  |  Name  |
    |         |<--------------|          |<--------|--| Server |
    |         | user responses|          |responses|  |        |
    +---------+               +----------+         |  +--------+
                                |     A            |
                cache additions |     | references |
                                V     |            |
                              +----------+         |
                              |  cache   |         |
                              +----------+         |

User programs interact with the domain name space through resolvers; the format of user queries and user responses is specific to the host and its operating system. User queries will typically be operating system calls, and the resolver and its cache will be part of the host operating system.  Less capable hosts may choose to implement the resolver as a subroutine to be linked in with every program that needs its services. Resolvers answer user queries with information they acquire via queries to foreign name servers and the local cache.

Note that the resolver may have to make several queries to several different foreign name servers to answer a particular user query, and hence the resolution of a user query may involve several network accesses and an arbitrary amount of time. The queries to foreign name servers and the corresponding responses have a standard format described in this memo, and may be datagrams.

Depending on its capabilities, a name server could be a standalone program on a dedicated machine or a process or processes on a large timeshared host. A simple configuration might be:

                 Local Host                        |  Foreign
                                                   |
      +---------+                                  |
     /         /|                                  |
    +---------+ |             +----------+         |  +--------+
    |         | |             |          |responses|  |        |
    |         | |             |   Name   |---------|->|Foreign |
    |  Master |-------------->|  Server  |         |  |Resolver|
    |  files  | |             |          |<--------|--|        |
    |         |/              |          | queries |  +--------+
    +---------+               +----------+         |

Here a primary name server acquires information about one or more zones by reading master files from its local file system, and answers queries about those zones that arrive from foreign resolvers.

The DNS requires that all zones be redundantly supported by more than one name server. Designated secondary servers can acquire zones and check for updates from the primary server using the zone transfer protocol of the DNS. This configuration is shown below:

                 Local Host                        |  Foreign
                                                   |
      +---------+                                  |
     /         /|                                  |
    +---------+ |             +----------+         |  +--------+
    |         | |             |          |responses|  |        |
    |         | |             |   Name   |---------|->|Foreign |
    |  Master |-------------->|  Server  |         |  |Resolver|
    |  files  | |             |          |<--------|--|        |
    |         |/              |          | queries |  +--------+
    +---------+               +----------+         |
                                A     |maintenance |  +--------+
                                |     +------------|->|        |
                                |      queries     |  |Foreign |
                                |                  |  |  Name  |
                                +------------------|--| Server |
                             maintenance responses |  +--------+

In this configuration, the name server periodically establishes a virtual circuit to a foreign name server to acquire a copy of a zone or to check that an existing copy has not changed. The messages sent for these maintenance activities follow the same form as queries and responses, but the message sequences are somewhat different.

The information flow in a host that supports all aspects of the domain name system is shown below:

                 Local Host                        |  Foreign
                                                   |
    +---------+               +----------+         |  +--------+
    |         | user queries  |          |queries  |  |        |
    |  User   |-------------->|          |---------|->|Foreign |

    |         | user responses|          |responses|  |        |

                cache additions |     | references |
                                V     |            |
                              +----------+         |
                              |  Shared  |         |

                              +----------+         |
                                A     |            |

    |         |/              |          | queries |  +--------+
    +---------+               +----------+         |
                                A     |maintenance |  +--------+
                                |     +------------|->|        |
                                |      queries     |  |Foreign |
                                |                  |  |  Name  |
                                +------------------|--| Server |
                             maintenance responses |  +--------+

The shared database holds domain space data for the local name server and resolver. The contents of the shared database will typically be a mixture of authoritative data maintained by the periodic refresh operations of the name server and cached data from previous resolver requests. The structure of the domain data and the necessity for synchronization between name servers and resolvers imply the general characteristics of this database, but the actual format is up to the local implementor.

Information flow can also be tailored so that a group of hosts act together to optimize activities.  Sometimes this is done to offload less capable hosts so that they do not have to implement a full resolver. This can be appropriate for PCs or hosts which want to minimize the amount of new network code which is required. This scheme can also allow a group of hosts can share a small number of caches rather than maintaining a large number of separate caches, on the premise that the centralized caches will have a higher hit ratio. In either case, resolvers are replaced with stub resolvers which act as front ends to resolvers located in a recursive server in one or more name servers known to perform that service:

                   Local Hosts                     |  Foreign
                                                   |
    +---------+                                    |
    |         | responses                          |
    | Stub    |<--------------------+              |

                               V    |              |
    +---------+ recursive     +----------+         |  +--------+

                              |  Central |         |
                              |   cache  |         |
                              +----------+         |

In any case, note that domain components are always replicated for reliability whenever possible.

### 2.3. Conventions

The domain system has several conventions dealing with low-level, but fundamental, issues. While the implementor is free to violate these conventions WITHIN HIS OWN SYSTEM, he must observe these conventions in ALL behavior observed from other hosts.

#### 2.3.1. Preferred name syntax

#### 2.3.2. Data Transmission Order

The order of transmission of the header and data described in this document is resolved to the octet level. Whenever a diagram shows a group of octets, the order of transmission of those octets is the normal order in which they are read in English. For example, in the following diagram, the octets are transmitted in the order they are numbered.

     0                   1
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       1       |       2       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       3       |       4       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       5       |       6       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Whenever an octet represents a numeric quantity, the left most bit in the diagram is the high order or most significant bit. That is, the bit labeled 0 is the most significant bit. For example, the following diagram represents the value 170 (decimal).

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Similarly, whenever a multi-octet field represents a numeric quantity the left most bit of the whole field is the most significant bit. When a multi-octet quantity is transmitted the most significant octet is transmitted first.

#### 2.3.3. Character Case

For all parts of the DNS that are part of the official protocol, all comparisons between character strings (e.g., labels, domain names, etc.) are done in a case-insensitive manner. At present, this rule is in force throughout the domain system without exception. However, future additions beyond current usage may need to use the full binary octet capabilities in names, so attempts to store domain names in 7-bit ASCII or use of special bytes to terminate labels, etc., should be avoided.

When data enters the domain system, its original case should be preserved whenever possible. In certain circumstances this cannot be done. For example, if two RRs are stored in a database, one at x.y and one at X.Y, they are actually stored at the same place in the database, and hence only one casing would be preserved. The basic rule is that case can be discarded only when data is used to define structure in a database, and two names are identical when compared in a case-insensitive manner.

#### 2.3.4. Size limits

Various objects and parameters in the DNS have size limits. They are listed below. Some could be easily changed, others are more fundamental.

labels: 63 octets or less
names: 255 octets or less
TTL: positive values of a signed 32 bit number.
UDP messages: 512 octets or less

## 3. Domain name space and RR definitions

### 3.1. Name space definitions

Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of labels. Each label is represented as a one octet length field followed by that number of octets. Since every domain name ends with the null label of the root, a domain name is terminated by a length byte of zero. The high order two bits of every length octet must be zero, and the remaining six bits of the length field limit the label to 63 octets or fewer.

To simplify implementations, the total length of a domain name (i.e., label octets and label length octets) is restricted to 255 octets or less.

Although labels can contain any 8 bit values in octets that make up a label, it is strongly recommended that labels follow the preferred syntax described elsewhere in this memo, which is compatible with existing host naming conventions. Name servers and resolvers must compare labels in a case-insensitive manner (i.e., A=a), assuming ASCII with zero parity. Non-alphabetic codes must match exactly.

### 3.2. RR definitions

#### 3.2.1. Format

All RRs have the same top level format shown below:

                                    1  1  1  1  1  1
      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                                               |
    /                                               /
    /                      NAME                     /
    |                                               |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                      TYPE                     |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                     CLASS                     |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                      TTL                      |
    |                                               |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                   RDLENGTH                    |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--|
    /                     RDATA                     /
    /                                               /
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

where:

NAME
an owner name, i.e., the name of the node to which this resource record pertains.

TYPE
two octets containing one of the RR TYPE codes.

CLASS
two octets containing one of the RR CLASS codes.

TTL
a 32-bit signed integer that specifies the time interval that the resource record may be cached before the source of the information should again be consulted. Zero values are interpreted to mean that the RR can only be used for the transaction in progress, and should not be cached. For example, SOA records are always distributed with a zero TTL to prohibit caching. Zero values can also be used for extremely volatile data.

RDLENGTH
an unsigned 16-bit integer that specifies the length in octets of the RDATA field.

RDATA
a variable length string of octets that describes the resource. The format of this information varies according to the TYPE and CLASS of the resource record.

#### 3.2.2. TYPE values

TYPE fields are used in resource records. Note that these types are a subset of QTYPEs.

| TYPE  | value | meaning                                  |

| MD    | 3     | a mail destination (Obsolete - use MX)   |
| MF    | 4     | a mail forwarder (Obsolete - use MX)     |
| CNAME | 5     | the canonical name for an alias          |

| TXT   | 16    | text strings                             |

#### 3.2.3. QTYPE values

QTYPE fields appear in the question part of a query. QTYPEs are a superset of TYPEs, hence all TYPEs are valid QTYPEs. In addition, the following QTYPEs are defined:

| QTYPE | value | meaning                                              |
|-------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| AXFR  | 252   | A request for a transfer of an entire zone           |
| MAILB | 253   | A request for mailbox-related records (MB, MG or MR) |
| MAILA | 254   | A request for mail agent RRs (Obsolete - see MX)     |
| *     | 255   | A request for all records                            |

#### 3.2.4. CLASS values

CLASS fields appear in resource records. The following CLASS mnemonics and values are defined:

| CLASS | value | meaning                                                                   |
|-------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IN    | 1     | the Internet                                                              |
| CS    | 2     | the CSNET class (Obsolete - used only for examples in some obsolete RFCs) |
| CH    | 3     | the CHAOs class                                                           |
| HS    | 4     | Hesiod                                                                    |

#### 3.2.5. QCLASS values

QCLASS fields appear in the question section of a query. QCLASS values are a superset of CLASS values; every CLASS is a valid QCLASS. In addition to CLASS values, the following QCLASSes are defined:

| QCLASS | value | meaning   |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| *      | 255   | any class |

### 3.3. Standard RRs

The following RR definitions are expected to occur, at least potentially, in all classes. In particular, NS, SOA, CNAME, and PTR will be used in all classes, and have the same format in all classes. Because their RDATA format is known, all domain names in the RDATA section of these RRs may be compressed.

`domain-name` is a domain name represented as a series of labels, and terminated by a label with zero length. `character-string` is a single length octet followed by that number of characters.  `character-string` is treated as binary information, and can be up to 256 characters in length (including the length octet).

## 4. Messages

### 4.1. Format

All communications inside the domain protocol are carried in a single format called a message. The top level format of message is divided into 5 sections (some of which are empty in certain cases) shown below:

    +---------------------+
    |        Header       |
    +---------------------+
    |       Question      | the question for the name server
    +---------------------+
    |        Answer       | RRs answering the question
    +---------------------+
    |      Authority      | RRs pointing toward an authority
    +---------------------+
    |      Additional     | RRs holding additional information
    +---------------------+

The header section is always present. The header includes fields that specify which of the remaining sections are present, and also specify whether the message is a query or a response, a standard query or some other opcode, etc.

The names of the sections after the header are derived from their use in standard queries. The question section contains fields that describe a question to a name server. These fields are a query type (QTYPE), a query class (QCLASS), and a query domain name (QNAME). The last three sections have the same format: a possibly empty list of concatenated resource records (RRs). The answer section contains RRs that answer the question; the authority section contains RRs that point toward an authoritative name server; the additional records section contains RRs which relate to the query, but are not strictly answers for the question.

#### 4.1.1. Header section format

The header contains the following fields:

                                    1  1  1  1  1  1
      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                      ID                       |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |QR|   Opcode  |AA|TC|RD|RA|   Z    |   RCODE   |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                    QDCOUNT                    |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                    ANCOUNT                    |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                    NSCOUNT                    |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    |                    ARCOUNT                    |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

where:

ID
A 16-bit identifier assigned by the program that generates any kind of query. This identifier is copied the corresponding reply and can be used by the requester to match up replies to outstanding queries.

QR
A 1-bit field that specifies whether this message is a query (0), or a response (1).

OPCODE
A 4-bit field that specifies kind of query in this message. This value is set by the originator of a query and copied into the response. The values are:
0: a standard query (QUERY)
1: an inverse query (IQUERY)
2: a server status request (STATUS)
3-15: reserved for future use

AA
Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses, and specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in question section.
Note that the contents of the answer section may have multiple owner names because of aliases. The AA bit corresponds to the name which matches the query name, or the first owner name in the answer section.

TC
TrunCation - specifies that this message was truncated due to length greater than that permitted on the transmission channel.

RD
Recursion Desired - this bit may be set in a query and is copied into the response. If RD is set, it directs the name server to pursue the query recursively. Recursive query support is optional.

RA
Recursion Available - this be is set or cleared in a response, and denotes whether recursive query support is available in the name server.

Z
Reserved for future use. Must be zero in all queries and responses.

RCODE
Response code - this 4-bit field is set as part of responses. The values have the following interpretation:
0: No error condition
1: Format error - The name server was unable to interpret the query.
2: Server failure - The name server was unable to process this query due to a problem with the name server.
3: Name Error - Meaningful only for responses from an authoritative name server, this code signifies that the domain name referenced in the query does not exist.
4: Not Implemented - The name server does not support the requested kind of query.
